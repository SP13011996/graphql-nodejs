# ToDo Application with GraphQL, Apollo, Prisma, HotChocolate, Entity Framework, React.js, Redux, and Apollo Client

This repository contains a ToDo application that demonstrates the usage of GraphQL servers implemented using Apollo and Prisma in Node.js, as well as HotChocolate and Entity Framework in .NET Core. The client is built using React.js, utilizing Redux for state management and Apollo Client for making GraphQL API calls.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete ToDo items.
- Real-time updates using GraphQL subscriptions.
- Server-side logic implemented using Apollo Server (Node.js) and HotChocolate (.NET Core).
- Persistent storage using Prisma (Node.js) and Entity Framework (.NET Core).
- Client-side state management using Redux.
- GraphQL API calls from the client using Apollo Client.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for Node.js based server)
- .NET Core SDK (for .NET Core based server)
- Visual Studio Code or any preferred code editor

## Getting Started

### Server (Node.js with Apollo and Prisma)

1. Navigate to the `server-node` directory.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure your database connection in the `.env` file.
4. Run database migrations using `npx prisma migrate dev`.
5. Start the Apollo Server using `npm start`.

### Server (.NET Core with HotChocolate and Entity Framework)

1. Open the `server-dotnet` directory in Visual Studio or your preferred .NET Core IDE.
2. Configure your database connection in the `appsettings.json` file.
3. Build and run the .NET Core server.

### Client (React.js with Redux and Apollo Client)

1. Navigate to the `client-react` directory.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Update the Apollo Client configuration in `src/apollo.js` to point to your server URLs.
4. Start the React development server using `npm start`.

## Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to the React app (by default, it runs on http://localhost:3000).
- You'll see a list of ToDo items fetched from the GraphQL server.
- Use the UI to add, update, or delete ToDo items.
- Changes are updated in real-time thanks to GraphQL subscriptions.

## Folder Structure

- `server-node`: Node.js based GraphQL server with Apollo Server and Prisma.
- `server-dotnet`: .NET Core based GraphQL server with HotChocolate and Entity Framework.
- `client-react`: React.js based client with Redux for state management and Apollo Client for GraphQL API calls.
